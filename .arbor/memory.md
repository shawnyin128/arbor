# Session Memory

<!--
What is still unresolved. This file answers the question a hook cannot: not what
changed, but why the work stopped and what is still open.

Do not record what the repository already records — code structure, past fixes,
git history, or anything already in AGENTS.md — and do not record what only
mattered to one conversation. If asked to remember one of those, work out what
was non-obvious about it and record that instead.

Update an entry rather than adding a near-duplicate. Delete an entry once it is
committed, documented, or decided. A short file gets read; a long one does not.

Each entry should say what is unresolved and what the next session should do
first. Naming a file or symbol makes a claim about how the code looked when the
entry was written, so a later session must confirm it still exists.
-->

## Unresolved

- Hooks have still not been observed firing from a real session. Receipts from the
  installed copy confirm all three run, but this repository's `session.json` stays
  absent until a session starts with the plugin loaded. Run `arbor doctor` in a new
  session and expect the three hook rows to turn `ok`.
